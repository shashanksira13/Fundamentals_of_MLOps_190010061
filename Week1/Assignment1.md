AIOps stands for Artificial Intelligence for IT operations. It is a paradigm shift that allows machines to solve 
IT issues without the need of human assistance or interaction. AIOPs uses machine learning and analytics to 
analyze big data obtained via different tools, which allows for issues to be spotted automatically and dealt 
with in real time.

AIOps can be defined as platforms that utilize big data, machine learning, and other advanced analytics technologies
to directly and indirectly enhance IT operations (such as monitoring, automation and service desk) functions with 
proactive, personal, and dynamic insight.  Put another way, AIOps refers to improving the way IT organizations 
manage data and information in their environments using artificial intelligence.

This is different from MLOps because MLOps is a multidisciplinary approach to managing machine learning algorithms
as ongoing products, each with its own continuous lifecycle. It's a discipline that aims to build, scale, and 
deploy algorithms to production consistently.It takes the DevOps methodology of continuous integration and 
continuous deployment and applies it to machine learning. As in traditional development, there is code that 
needs to be written and deployed, as well as bug testing to be done, and changes in user requirements to be 
accommodated. Specific to the topic of machine learning, models are being trained with data, and new data is 
introduced to retrain the models again and again.
